            <h2>Talk Notes</h2>
            <p>Hello. I'm Matt Gauger, and I'm a developer at Bendyworks in Madison, WI.</p>

            <p>Bendyworks was founded on the ideas of agile &amp; software craftsmanship - it's in our culture, and we talk about it a lot. Over past few years weâ€™ve experimented with adding apprenticeship to our practices.</p>
            <p>Today, I'd like to talk about the software craftsmanship movement, and a practice that I'd like to see more regularly used with it: apprenticeship.</p>

            <h3>Apprenticeship: Software Craftsmanship's Missing Link</h3>
            <p>The idea of turning software into a craft versus another type of discipline gives us core values that fit very well with the idea of apprenticeship: a lifelong pursuit of learning &amp; improvement; pragmatic processes over "its always been done that way," sharing knowledge, and a willingness to try &amp; fail.</p>
            <p>Of all the practices in our toolbelts, apprenticeship should be another tool that we use, when appropriate.</p>
            <p>Adding apprenticeships to our practice of software craftsmanship is a key part of building a sustainable industry.</p>
            <p>But what do I mean by a "sustainable industry"?</p>

            <h3>Towards a Sustainable Industry</h3>

            <p>In farming, we have this idea of permaculture. The idea being that we can build farms that are sustainable:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>they produce the food that people need</li>
              <li>they don't deplete natural resources</li>
              <li>they don't pollute</li>
              <li>and they feed back into themselves to produce next year's crops.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Permaculture in farming is proof that by carefully choosing the practices we implement, we can sustain our livelihood.</p>
            <p>Doesn't that sound like a good idea for our industry, too? &mdash; A system that helps grow the next generation of developers.</p>

            <h3>The Sasquatch in the room</h3>
            <p>There's some big problems with how people enter the tech industry, and how we hire.</p>
            <p>The first problem I see is that most companies have an HR department set up to only hire for a set of skills &amp; experience on a resume. We need to get over the idea that a 4-year computer science degree is required for what we do. Or, that we should look for years of experience when we use such rapidly-changing tools.</p>
            <p>Instead, I'd like to talk about how we can hire passionate people, full of potential, and train them in the skills we use every day.</p>

            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
            <p>The other problem is one of just getting into the field in the first place. A lot of us had opportunities that led us here: there was an Apple II at school, or we had an early internet connection, or we were able to spend our weekends learning Rails.</p>
            <p>In any case, we're here, and those particular opportunities allow us to be here.</p>
            <p>This is a problem: one of diversity. There's tons of research out there that shows that diverse teams are more creative, better at solving complex problems, and make more profits than their competitors.</p>
            <p>But, we rarely focus diversity. And we should be.</p>
            <p>We need to look at diversity on our teams when we talk about software craftsmanship. Software craftsmanship demands that we expose ourselves to new perspectives and new ideas.</p>
            <p>Hiring more people like us is not working. It's a monoculture, it's not sustainable.</p>
            <p>The missing link is how we bring new developers into the fold: how we teach them what we already know. Our teams all hold a ton of group knowledge, built up over time. But how do we expect the next generation to learn all that?</p>
            <p>Notes to be continued&hellip;</p>

            <h2>Example Checklist</h2>
            <p>There were a lot of requests to see Bendywork's Checklist. Someday we'd like to open source our apprenticeship materials, but for now, I made a quick example checklist of the kinds of things that our checklist contains.</p>
            <p>Note that <strong>Level 1</strong> is basic knowledge to pick up, where <strong>Level 2</strong> is what we'd like the apprentice to know as a prerequisite to billing on a project.</p>
            <p>Remember that the goals for checklist items is that they are <strong>demonstrable</strong> and <strong>achievable</strong>. In many cases, for <strong>Level 2</strong>, we ask that the apprentice explain the topic to us to prove knowledge.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
